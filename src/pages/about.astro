          <p>
            Born in the charming town of Veliko Turnovo, my journey into the
            world of technology began with a childhood fascination for
            computers. This passion led me to Sofia, where I studied Network
            Technologies at NBU. Eager to broaden my horizons, I transitioned to
            Project Management for my master's degree, blending technical
            expertise with leadership skills.
          </p>

            My career took an exciting turn when I joined GSMArena, where I
            immersed myself in writing articles about mobile technology and
            smartphones. This role not only honed my writing skills but also
            allowed me to code several redesigns of the website and develop
            internal tools. The thrill of traveling to tech shows around the
            world added a dynamic edge to my work.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the web development landscape evolved, so did my career
            aspirations. I joined Sellercloud, an American-based company
            dedicated to simplifying e-commerce and warehouse logistics. Here,
            as a Senior Frontend Engineer, I've developed several applications
            that have significantly improved client operations.
          </p><p>
            Away from the screen, I cherish my time with Rositsa, my lovely
            fianc√©e, and our handsome blonde cat, Cappuccino. Whether it's
            traveling, biking, or tinkering with the latest tech gadgets, I find
            joy in life's simple pleasures and cutting-edge innovations.
